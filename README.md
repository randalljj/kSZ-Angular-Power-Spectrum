# kSZ-Angular-Power-Spectrum
Directed student research project from my time at UCF as a Physics major. Was not completed so I am trying to complete it now. Dr. James Cooney is my advisor.

Hi my name is Jesse Randall. I was a Physics student at UCF from 2014 to 2019. During my final year I did directed student research in the field of cosmology which I am currently hoping to go to graduate school for. Dr. James Cooney is my advisor for the project and I am very thankful for his patience and guidance. I was unable to finish this project while I was at UCF and took a long break from it due to personal health reasons.

Now I am returning to the project after two years and endeavor to finish what I started. So far I haven't made much progress in overcoming the barriers I ran into before but I have made a lot of progress on improving my coding practice. To start, I turned my Python script into a Jupyter Notebook to make taking notes and collaboration with Dr. Cooney much easier. I also started using using version control with Git and GitHub.

Hoping to finsih this project in the next couple months and am glad to be doing what I enjoy again.
